🎯 USAGE STRATEGY:
  ✅ ALWAYS prefer to start with a broad search without specifying any source and then narrow down the search with a specific source when needed
  ✅ For relevant API endpoints or SDK methods in the sections returned, invoke this tool again with the specific source to get more detailed information
  ✅ For API endpoints referenced, always remember to explicitly check how to perform API authentication
  ✅ For SDK methods referenced, always remember to explicitly check how to initialize the SDK

🚨 PRIVACY & SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
• ❌ NEVER include PII (Personally Identifiable Information) in questions
• ❌ NEVER include account IDs, user IDs, email addresses, or customer data
• ❌ NEVER include API keys, tokens, or credentials
• ❌ NEVER include transaction IDs, payment references, or financial data
• ✅ Use generic examples like 'how to process payments' instead of specific account details
• ✅ Focus on technical concepts, API endpoints, and implementation patterns
• ✅ API version information is permitted as an exception (e.g., '2023-09-30')`,
    SEARCH_DOCS: `Search Airwallex platform documentation for technical information, API references, and integration guides.

    VALIDATE_REQUEST_SCHEMA: `Validate generated code that makes API requests to the Airwallex API.
Validates generated code that involves making API requests to Airwallex API for correctness and quality. 
  **REQUIRED WORKFLOW**: When you generate any code that involves Airwallex APIs for the user, you MUST: 
  (1) Generate the code, 
  (2) Immediately call this validation tool, 
  (3) Review validation results, 
  (4) Fix any issues found, 
  (5) Validate again if changes were made, 
  (6) Only present code to user after passing validation. 
  Never skip validation - it ensures that users are protected from broken or unsafe code.
* This tool does NOT execute the API request or return live data. It ONLY checks if the request made (as a result of running the generated code) is valid according to the schema.
* If the request requires input, use sensible example values that match the data type used in the code. 
* If the code uses variables, use placeholder values that match the expected format. 
* If the request body is dynamically generated, perform a validation for each type of variation
* DO NOT use real or sensitive data.
* if AIRWALLEX_API_VERSION is not set, use "latest" as the default version. 
 
📋 This tool validates the request body, headers, query parameters, HTTP method, and route against the Airwallex API schema for the specified version. It helps ensure that requests are correctly formed before sending them to the Airwallex API.`,

# @awx-devx/mcp

Airwallex Developer MCP Server empowers AI coding agents to be helpful assistants for developers integrating with the [API platform](https://www.airwallex.com/docs/).

This local MCP Server provides agents with tools to:

- Search the Airwallex Product, API & SDK documentation
- Create test resources, explore curated platform features & simulate select actions safely on the Sandbox environment

## Example Prompts

> Using Airwallex, can you find me test card numbers for the 3DS authentication failure case?

> Integrate Airwallex's Drop-in element with this website

> I tried to make a payout with Airwallex and got it this error: amount_below_transfer_method_limit. What does that mean?

> Using Airwallex, can you find me test card numbers for the 3DS authentication failure case?

> Can you create a new billing plan on Airwallex called Startup for $29.99 and create a URL that I can pass to a user to signup with. Also, find me test card details that I can use to pay as a customer.

## Environment Variables

Account-specific Sandbox API tools will only be available if the Sandbox API credentials are configured using the environment variables below. You can create a Airwallex Sandbox account [here](https://demo.airwallex.com/signup/sandbox).

| Name                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Default | Required |

Note that the Sandbox tools will only work as expected if this API key has the required permissions to access the underlying APIs. The Admin API key is currently required to access the Simulation APIs. | N/A     | No       |
| `AIRWALLEX_SANDBOX_CLIENT_ID` | Client ID associated with the Client API key from the Sandbox environment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | N/A     | No       |

## Disclaimer

The use of the `search_public_docs` tool in this MCP server can help _reduce_ hallucination in the Airwallex-related integration code produced by your coding agent but does not _eliminate_ it. Please always review, validate and test AI-generated code before using it in Production.

## Feedback

This server is built and maintained by the Developer Experience team at Airwallex and we'd love to know what you think of it. You can send feedback directly to us at `developer.support@airwallex.com`. Please remember to mention the AI model that your coding agent was connected to.

## Telemetry

Currently, telemetry is enabled by default. This can be disabled by setting the `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `true`. We collect anonymous data related to MCP tool invocations.
